                        <p class="mt-5 mb-5">Kant contrasts the good will (i.e. how someone is when they do the right thing because it is 
the right thing to do) to other things which are only conditionally good. (Kant, GW, 4:393, 7)
 Example: “gifts of nature”, such as talents (understanding, wit, judgment) and admirable qualities of temperament (courage, resolution, perseverance) are only good if directed by a good will. Example: “gifts of fortune” such as power, riches, honor, health, even happiness, etc. produce 
boldness and even arrogance unless a good will can check them (i.e. constrain and direct them).
